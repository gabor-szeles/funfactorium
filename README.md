# funfactorium

Fun facts are fun, as their name indicates, and also very educational. 
This project is about providing an API and frontend functionality in the spirit of education and entertainment
(or "edutainment"). 

The project's main goal is to be a practice for Spring security and front end development with a Javascript framework 
of my choice. Development is done using Continuous Delivery, setting up and maintaining
the pipeline is also part of the practice.

Here's a fun fact though: this is my very first pet project!
